# Covid19_detection_using_AmazonSagemaker

The effective management of the global epidemic now depends critically on the quick and accurate detection of COVID-19. A widely utilized and reasonably priced diagnostic method for finding COVID-19 is chest X-ray imaging. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in particular, are used in the proposed method to automatically extract significant features from X-ray pictures and classify them as COVID-19 positive, COVID-19 negative, and maybe other lung-related disorders. To provide a scalable and cloud-based solution for real-time inference, the model will be deployed toAmazon EC2 using Amazon Sage Maker.
